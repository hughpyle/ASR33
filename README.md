[![teletype model 33](pix/20180925_170552_x400.jpg)](pix/20180925_170552.jpg)

* Some Background:
    * History: [ASCII, Unix and the ASR33](doc/01-history.md) 
    * So, what exactly is a [Teletype terminal?](doc/02-teletype.md)
    * [About This Project](doc/03-project.md)

* Getting Connected:
    * [There are lots of options](doc/04-connections.md) for connecting a Teletype to a computer.
    * I've built some quite simple custom [Hardware](hardware/README.md): electronics to operate the 20mA current-loop,
      and [Firmware](firmware/README.md): using a Teensy microcontroller for a modern USB connection.
    * Connecting to [MacOS](osx/README.md) and to a [Raspberry Pi](rpi/README.md) (with some `getty` and `terminfo` Unix archaeology, and a [kernel patch for linux](https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33/tree/master/rpi/kernel))


* Making It Useful:
    * [Applications](bin/README.md) including command-line utilities for the tty user.  Includes scripts to print [words on papertape](https://twitter.com/33asr/status/1074432596728262656), connect to [LambdaMoo](https://twitter.com/33asr/status/1078698114003943425), print [emoji](https://twitter.com/33asr/status/1046930898321645568), play [zork](https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33/blob/master/bin/profile), run [state-of-the art language AI](https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33/blob/master/gpt2/README.md), connect to [bbs](https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33/blob/master/bin/_bbs) and [old mainframes](https://github.com/hughpyle/ASR33/blob/master/bin/_cdc), and more.
    * Using [CUPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS) to make the Teletype appear as a network printer.
    * [ASCII Art](asciiart/README.md) using the unique features of an antique hard-copy terminal, including _overstrike_.
    * [Paper Tape Art](bin/patterns/README.md) too.
